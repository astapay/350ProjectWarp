Description: PW-350 was a test subject all his life for the laboratory Warp Corp.
	     Our main character has the ability to teleport across entire multiverses,
	     and Warp Corp. wanted to use these powers for their own personal gain.
	     Thankfully, the test subject is able to escape his captors, but they
